# EE596-hw2-CNN-and-hyperparameter-searches
This is the second homework for Practical Introduction To Neural Network. This homework mainly focus on two basic CNN architecture,
respectively LeNet-5 and AlexNet. They are trained using MNIST dataset and CIFAR-10.
The other goal that this homework aims at is to let me get familiar with the hyperparameter searches and use various optimization techniques to
improve the generalization of neural networks.
